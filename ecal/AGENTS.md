# Repository Guidelines

- `energyprint.html` intentionally **does not** include `style.css` or other
  external CSS. This is a deliberate choice to keep the printed certificate
  visually consistent. Do not link `style.css` here even if it seems obvious.

- Adding code linters or their configuration is unwanted.

- Some `_help` entries in `strings.js` are blank on purpose. Leave them empty if
  there is no help text to provide.

- Help tooltips appear and disappear abruptly by design. Please do not add
  animations or transitions.
- Limited location options are intentional and match the available factors in Ã…land's regulations.
